This is a Beta release, there are cerainly bugs that need to be found and fixed.  
Please report bugs and requests for new features to the private email box of 
"erosoutsider" in the SmartStim web site.  When requesting features, remember
that this is a volinteer effort, that we are limited based on what the device is
capable of doing, and that our goal is scripting not interactive control.

This package is not ready for general use.  It is presently only suitable
for experienced computer geek types, preferrable familar with the Perl programming
language. At a minimum you have to be willing and able to install ActivePerl and to 
use command line windows.  You will need a serial cable like the one ErosTek provides
with their ErosLink product, and preferrably you will need the ErosLink product.
See manual.doc for the cable details.

If you are planning to convert this package to another language, but still 
support a scripting language, it would be a good idea to use the same script syntax
as presented here, so that folks can share their scripts with others.

Installation notes:

1) Begin by installing ActivePerl on your machine.  ActivePerl is a free package, 
you can get it from ActiveState at:  

       http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/

I recommend you use the Windows MSI method to install.  After downloading and 
saving to disk, click on the file to start the installer running.  The default 
options should be fine.


2) Create a directory called C:\eros and unzip all of ESTIM.ZIP into it.  Make sure to let 
unzip recreate the subdirectories.


3) Go to the directory C:\eros\install   and double click on the file install.bat
This script will:

    install Win32-API unless already installed.
    install Win32::SerialPort
    install WxPerl
    install IPC::UDPmsg.pm
    install IO::estim.pm



4) Using ErosLink, install the session  Idle.eis  as User 1.


5) To run the test program, connect the ESTIM device to your serial port, the 
software assumes you are using port 1, and you will need to adjust the source
code if using something different. Look for the line where $port is set.
The waves.txt script works best if the device is runnning the idle.eis installed 
in step 4. Power cycle the ESTIM device. Open a command window, and type:

     cd c:\eros
     perl test.pl

7) To run the GUI, connect up the ESTIM device to your serial port, the 
software assumes you are using port 1, and you will need to adjust the source
code if using something different. Look for the line where $port is set.
Power cycle the ET-312 (unless you just ran test.pl).  Open a command window, 
and type:

    cd c:\eros
    perl    script.pl


In the FILE menu, open the file  "waves.txt", then select "run" also from the 
file menu.  The waves.txt script works best if the device is runnning the
idle.eis installed in step 4. 

Note that script.pl and test.pl use the special feature that makes it not
necessary to repower the ESTIM device each time the program is started, as long
as it's only used with them.  Any time other software, such as ErosLink, is
used to communicate with the device, you will need to power cycle the device 
before these scripts will work.
