* ET312 Protocol Documentation
** Introduction

This document is a specification for the serial communications
protocol of the ET312 Electrostimulation box by Erostek. The protocol
was put together through multiple sources:

- Serial monitoring of box communications with various controls
  software
- Mapping from the original erosoutsider perl files
- Message board/Mailing list posts from around the internet

The following specifications are for v1.6 of the Erostek firmware,
which it is assumed all modern boxes are running.

** Protocol and Communication Basics
*** Communication via Link Cable

Communicating with the ET312 box happens via an RS-232 Connection to
the Link port of the box. The link cable consists of a 3.5mm TRS
(stereo audio) jack, going to some sort of computer connection, be it
Female DB-9 or a RS232-to-USB converter. The pin connections are as
follows:

- 3.5mm Tip <-> RX (DB-9 Pin 2)
- 3.5mm Ring <-> TX (DB-9 Pin 3)
- 3.5mm Sleeve <-> Ground (DB-9 Pin 5)

Serial connections are 19200/8/N/1, or:

- 19200 baud
- Data Bits: 8
- Stop Bits: 1
- Partity: None

*** Encryption
Communication with the box is encrypted, using a simple XOR stream
cipher.

** Handshake

*** HELLO (Connection establishment)

Handshaking consists of a byte sent to the box, and a byte received
back:

- 0x00 is sent to ET312
- 0x07 is read from ET312

This needs to happen 3 times in order for the handshake to be valid.

*** XOR Key Synchronization

After the HELLO ends, XOR keys must be set up. This involves sending a
2 byte sequence to the box, and receiving 3 bytes back:

- [0x2f, 0x00] sent to ET312
- [0x21, 0xXX, oxYY] is read from ET312

Where:

- 0xXX is the stream XOR key, an unsigned 8-bit number
- 0xYY is a checksum, the 8-bit unsigned sum of the first two bytes,
  possibly wrapped if the sum is > 255. 

For instance:

- [0x2f, 0x00] is sent to ET312
- [0x21, 0x8f, 0xb0] is read from ET312, meaning
  - 0x8f is the XOR key
  - 0xb0 is the checksum (0x21 + 0x8f)

*** XOR Key Usage

Once the XOR key is agreed upon, all further communication going from
host to ET312 is required to be encoded using the following scheme,
using ^ as an XOR operator:

Data Byte ^ XOR Key ^ (XOR Key ^ 0x55)

Only data sent requires encryption, all data received from the ET312
will be cleartext.

** Commands
*** Parameters
**** Parameter Read/Write Command Format

Commands sent to the ET-312 are a minimum of 3 bytes:

- Byte 0: Read or Write (Read: 0x3C, Write: 0x4D)
- Byte 1: Port Specifier (A: 0x40, B: 0x41)
- Byte 2: Parameter Specifier
- Byte 3-N: Data to be Written (Optional)

So, for example, to read (0x3C) the time on parameter (0x98) for port
A (0x40), we would send

0x3C 0x40 0x98

Note that this packet would need to be XOR'd using the algorithm laid
out in the "XOR Key Usage" section above.
